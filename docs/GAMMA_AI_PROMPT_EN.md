## SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION & CONTEXT (Speaker: Agata)

## Slide 1: Dante Alighieri and the Architecture of "Commedia"
*   **Context**: Dante (1265-1321), the architect of the Italian language.
*   **The Journey**: From the existential crisis of exile to universal salvation.
*   **Mission**: Using the vernacular to explore the "geography" of the human soul.
**[PLACEHOLDER FOR IMAGE: Use the generated "dante_ai_collaboration" image showing Dante looking at an AI]**

## Slide 2: The Prologue: The Emotional Labyrinth of Canto I
*   **Incipit**: An allegory of the human condition *in medias res*.
*   **Emotional Symbols**: The Dark Forest (Despair), the Hill (Divine Hope), the Three Beasts (Primal Fear).
*   **Objective**: Bridging traditional exegesis with modern computational metrics.

## Slide 3: From Digital Archives to Distant Reading (Speaker: Agata)
*   **Distant Reading**: Analyzing narrative patterns across thousands of verses via algorithms.
*   **Word Embeddings**: Visualizing the "Semantic Neighborhood" (e.g., how close is 'God' to 'Sun' in Dante's mind?).
*   **Innovation**: Digital Humanities as a bridge between the 14th and 21st centuries.

## SECTION 2: LOGIC & GLOBAL RESULTS (Speaker: Giuseppe)

## Slide 4: Baseline: The Lexical Method
*   **The Unit**: Analysis of **tercets** (the DNA of the Commedia).
*   **The Tool**: A custom Keyword Dictionary (Lexicon) searching for specific emotional anchors.
*   **The Pivot Emotions**: Fear, Bewilderment, Hope, Anger, Sadness.
*   **📊 Result: [lexicon_curve.png]**: This graph represents the **raw statistical frequency** of emotional keywords. If a word like "fear" is present, the curve peaks; if the emotion is expressed via metaphor (like light on a hill), the curve remains flat. It is a visual capture of the dictionary's limits: it sees words, but not meaning.
*   **The Limit**: Rigid and "blind" to metaphors; it can only see what is explicitly named.

## Slide 5: Logic-Based Analysis: Zero-Shot NLI
*   **The Leap**: **mDeBERTa-v3** - Moving from word-counting to Logical Inference.
*   **Zero-Shot Logic**: AI understands the "concept" of an emotion without ever being trained on Dante.
*   **Sliding Window**: Analyzing blocks of 2 tercets to capture the narrative flow and context.
*   **Natural Language Inference**: Not labeling words, but asking: *"Does this text logically entail 'Hope'?"*.

## Slide 6: Visualizing the Results: NLI Logic in Action
*   **The Full Journey**: Analyzing the emotion curve across the entire Canto (all 46 tercets).
*   **Filling the Silence**: How AI logic finds meaning in passages where the Lexicon/Dictionary fails.
*   **Intensity Heatmap**: A "snapshot" visual showing where emotions are strongest in the narrative.
*   **Scientific Validation**: Proving that the NLI model correctly tracks the Pilgrim's psychological evolution.

## SECTION 3: CRITICAL ANALYSIS & CONCLUSIONS (Speaker: Rebecca)

## Slide 7: Linguistic Bias and Orthographic Normalization
*   **The Challenge**: Modern AI vs. 700-year-old Italian.
*   **The Bridge**: `normalizer.py` - Custom script for orthographic modernization.
*   **Sample Rules**:
    - *huomo* → *uomo* (Latin spellings)
    - *avea* → *aveva* (Verb forms)
    - *ch'i'* → *che io* (Elisions)
*   **Rationale**: Vital for the dictionary to function; accessory for the flexible AI.
** SPEAKER NOTES FOR REBECCA: **
"Digital analysis is not a magic box; it requires careful data preparation. Our 'normalizer' acts as a linguistic bridge. While the AI is elastic enough to understand archaic forms, the Lexicon is rigid. We normalized the text for both to ensure a scientifically fair comparison."

## Slide 8: Case Study 1: Bewilderment in the Dark Forest
*   **Text**: *"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita..."* (In the middle of the journey of our life...)
*   **The Conflict**: Twitter-based models see "Sadness". Our NLI model sees **"Bewilderment"**.
*   **Reasoning**: AI understands the logic of "losing one's way," not just the surface mood.
** SPEAKER NOTES FOR REBECCA: **
"In the very first verses, common sentiment models fail by labeling the scene as mere sadness. By using NLI, our study proves that the machine can grasp the existential 'smarrimento'—the loss of direction—which is the true theological and emotional core of the incipit."

## Slide 9: Conclusions and Future Horizons
*   **Impact**: Deep emotional detection where traditional keyword methods remain silent.
*   **Philosophy**: The AI is the "Telescope," the Critic is the "Astronomer."
*   **The Future**: Towards LLMs specifically trained on Old Italian and Digital Philology.
** SPEAKER NOTES FOR REBECCA: **
"We've shown that AI doesn't replace the critic; it provides a new 'telescope' to see deep narrative patterns. As LLMs evolve, we will soon have tools that can analyze the entire Commedia, preserving the linguistic soul of the 14th century while using the most advanced logic of the 21st."
